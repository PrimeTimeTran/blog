###### Included Walkthrough
I decided to post an actual video instead of a gif because I feel like it's a better way to explain the app and it's uses.
If you feel like you want me to use the licecap software then don't hesitate to tell me and I'll do it the way you wanted me to.

###### Notes

I had difficulty with the routing for a sec but thanks to Cang giving me a pointer on what I did wrong I figured it out.

My chief complaint is the the requirements are a little bit vague.

I also didn't include all of the functionality that was listed in this template because the instructions aren't clear on whether or not they're "required".
Although it says required on the template the introductions found <http://courses.coderschool.vn/ruby/prework> don't mention having to have a search feature
or search terms for the posts.
