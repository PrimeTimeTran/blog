###### Video Walkthrough
I decided to post an actual video instead of a gif because I feel like it's a better way to explain the app and it's uses.
If you feel like you want me to use the licecap software then don't hesitate to tell me and I'll do it the way you wanted me to.

###### Notes

I had difficulty with the routing for a sec but thanks to Cang giving me a pointer on what I did wrong I figured it out.

My primary trouble was my job and not being able to spend a ton of time on it. Otherwise I thought it went pretty smoothly except for a few configuration errors I had to spend a some time researching on how to resolve.## License
