                  I'm currently playing on offense, defense, and special teams. I've been called a "mover and a shaker", "my right hand", and "the trigger man";
                  but I'm not hubris enough to suggest that they're absolutely correct... but I'm not scared to say that I'm trying!<br><br>

                  The company that I work for provides technical and professional expertise and services to small businesses, NGO's, and international conglomerates.
                  Our current major project is further developing a social services app which we originally created. It allows case workers
                  to quickly access and generate data concerning orphaned & at-risk children here. Features include reporting, synopsis overviews,
                  case legacies, generating government forms and numerous other client requested features.
                <br><br>
                  Our Chief Technical Officer once hilariously told me "The clients think we're magicians, they want to be able to click one button and see <b>everything</b>."<br><br>
                  Alas, engineer's are not in fact magicians... we're charged with managing the <b>technical</b> details.<br><br>

                  We've expanded our company's portfolio into a range of applications and web services; the number and varity of these applications are too numerous to explain on my personal portfolio page.
                  If you're interested in knowing more about some of the applications we've developed don't hesitate to drop me an email.

                  I'm serving as Account Strategist, Chief Designer, and Software Engineer here in Cambodia currently.

                  My responsibilites as Account Strategist include meeting with owners, project managers, and clients to fully understand what their expectations are and serve
                  as a bridge between the clients and our company. After grasping a better understanding of the demands of the client I'm responsible with articulating these
                  requirements to the project team members, Chief Technical Officer, and Chief Executive Officer. Equally important in this responsibility is that I must also manage the
                  expectations of the client, communicating when demands are beyond technical reach or scope of the contracts which both the client and our company have previous agreed to.<br><br>
                  Another important element of this role is to identify potential future clients and prepare proposals for how our company can help to bring them business solutions
                  . Evaluating and identifying issues with client business solutions and formulating strategies as to how our company can fix these problems
                  is mission critical to success in securing contracts for our company.
                  Formulating strategy, projections, and deadlines for future projects along with other project team members of their company as well as ours is also tremendously
                  critical as Account Strategist.<br><br>

                  Here's an example video I made<br>
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qJiLYLZBc4">here</a>. =)

                  Traditionally educated at <a href="https://www.tcc.fl.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Tallahassee Community College</a> and <a href="https://www.fsu.edu/">
                    Florida State University.</a> That being said, I believe many lessons lie <u style="color: red">outside the classroom</u>... perhaps maybe; on the job training? Perhaps in Life?<br>
                    <p class="about_us_p">Sure, I'm scared of failing. But I'm even more scared of <u style="color: red">not even trying</u>...<br>
                      <br>That's why I decided to forgo my acceptence to a few prestigous universities in the U.S.A and <u>pursue other</u> <u style="color: red">opportunities</u>...
                      <br>
                      <br>I was introduced to Computer Science when I challenged myself to complete
                      <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">Harvard's CS50 certificate.</a><br>
                      <br>One taste was all it took to make me a fiend. The growth, learning, and career opportunities were more than enough to keep me motivated; plus I like it when people
                      <u style="color: red">think I'm smart</u> because I read stuff on the internet... haha.<br>
                      <br>I'm taking no prisoners in my fight to become the best <u style="color: red">software engineer I can be...</u> for my friends, family, and self.<br><br>
                      One year goal is to complete half of <a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science">MIT's</a> online Computer Science program hosted thanks to the kind
                      people at <a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science">OSS University GitHub.</a><br>
                      My favorite learning course though has got to be Team_Tree_House. They've put together some amazing content.

                      I've created a todo_list using Ruby & Rails. The todo_list contains data validations, rspec tests, and numerous other quality control features.
                      Another project I've completed is creating a IMDB like clone called <a href="http://nhieuflix.herokuapp.com/">NhieuFlix</a>.
                      This project also included using rspec to ensure that the program functioned the way we expected it to.

                      This project was pivotal in helping me to learn MVC programming as well as REST. These two schools of thought in programming
                      has given me the skills to much quicker than I might otherwise have; evaluate and correct bugs in web applications and various other frameworks.

                      I've also created a biller application which tracks billable hours to clients on behalf of employees.
                      I've also learned the implications of ActiveRecord and the purposes it serves within rails. ActiveRecord is an amazing tool
                      for migrations and maintaining databases. Learning these frameworks and gems has helped me to streamline the process
                      of getting an application up and running quickly and efficiently. They have also helped me to understand the nuances involved
                      when attempting to maintain data integrity.

                      I've also created a blog which has taught me a ton of other things as well... but that's personal!

                      I've completed and/or am working on certificates at <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/primetimetran">Free Code Camp</a>.
                      I've got exposure to things such as Ruby advanced algorithim scripting, Ruby on Rails, mySQL, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Gem, Bundler, Github, BitBucket, node.js, bootstrap, Google
                      Analytics and Ruby Metaprogramming. <br><br>

                      <br>Trust me when I say that I can push it, I can pull it, and I'll even <u style="color: red">fork it how you want me to</u>; not for me, but for us...<br>
